# Practical task on the Kubernetes topic

We have some application on the [RoR](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) written.

The task is:

1. Dockerize the application
2. Create appropriate Kubernetes manifest files to be placed in the `k8s` folder
3. The manifests should define a `webapp-service` service with the application running on port `80` - ![](.github/images/kubernetes.jpg)
